This is an integration interface for manageing Users and Groups in Swyx/Netphone from Active Directory.
Its written in 100% in Powershell.
There are some things that still have to be done by hand, but it should take care of the most common things.

Features:
-User creation (Name, Internal number, External number, email)
-User info updating
-User enable and disable (based on ad account state)
-Writing back formatted phone numbers back to ad.
-Group Managment

Stuff i think is missing:
-Multi-Language for notifications (They are currently in german)
